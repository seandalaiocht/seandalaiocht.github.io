title: Introduction and Deep Questions to Consider
---

First post on my new blog "Seandálaíocht - Irish for Archaeology".

I'd like wet your appetite a bit for things to come by giving some small background introduction to topics and themes I will discuss on this blog.

It is easy to consider Ireland and the Irish as the victims of history — if you have any doubt, just spend some time reviewing the background video which I'll be posting tomorrow — but ultimately it should also be understood that their mass outward migration can be celebrated as a two-way exchange of people, ideas, and culture between Ireland and the world. The dispersal of the Irish throughout the world and their contribution to the economies and cultures of those lands is one of the defining elements of Ireland's past and present. The Irish Diaspora, or scattering, is estimated to be in excess of 70 million people and is the largest in the world, exceeding those of the Greek, Italian, Chinese, Indian, Jewish, and other Diaspora.

While the identity of most of those who left is not known, their influence has been significant and enduring. With regards specifically to the United States, large numbers of Irish immigrants served as workers who made substantial contributions to the build-up of canals, roads, and railways that connect our nation. Today, there are over 41 million Americans who can claim Irish ancestry. This represents 14% of the U.S. Population. I wish to impress upon readers of Irish descent a greater appreciation for their heritage. It is my belief proper approaches to historical archaeology can shed light and give voice to those who were underrepresented or even misrepresented by history. With this in mind, I shall introduce readers to some findings from contemporary research into the Irish experience in the United States.

We live in a complex and multi-cultural world, yet our ethnic identity still carries much weight for how we perceive daily life. I hope to impart some sense for how highly influential this sense of identity and belonging that goes with ethnicity can be. I will illustrate how ethnicity was applied in efforts to mobilize groups of people in pursuit of political goals that frequently resulted in oppression, discrimination, and suffering. We should not forget however that ethnicity also empowered minorities to liberate themselves from the oppression that was directed towards them.

I hope to use this blog to attempt to explore several deep questions pertaining to the Irish Diaspora and the shift in identity that occurred in the late-19th century from Irish to Irish American. The following are some of the key questions that you should consider as you explore my blog:

* What led to the great emigrations of the Irish people?
* What social and political causes were involved?
* How did economic and environment conditions participate?
* What was life like after immigration?
* What eventual social and political changes resulted in improvements for Irish-Americans.
