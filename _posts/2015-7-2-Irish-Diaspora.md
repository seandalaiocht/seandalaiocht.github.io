The influx of Irish immigrants to America during the nineteenth century represents a major feature of the Irish Diaspora. For this context, diaspora refers to the forced dispersal or scattering of people from a homeland as the result of famine, war, enslavement, ethnic cleansing, conquest, and political repression. These events and processes form the reasons for "flight following violence" in place of freely chosen displacement. In all cases, the circumstances for quitting the homeland are traumatic and extraordinary, often resulting from the effects of colonialism. Circumstances involving a foreign group that has established arbitrary power over an indigenous group are particularly damaging. Native people are considered separate from and subordinate to the ruling authority. The status quo maintained through relations of racism and racialization.

At the beginning of the seventeenth century, English run in Ireland was established along with Protestant Ascendancy. As a functional colony, the Irish Catholic majority (850,000) was forced to be subordinate to the Protestant minority (160,000). Laws were passed which confiscated land owned by Irish Catholics and resettled them to Connacht. After the Act of Union was signed, Ireland was made to be a subordinate colony and the Irish Parliament was abolished. Ireland lost its ability to act on a developing agricultural crisis.

Land ownership quickly transitioned to a small elite land-owning class at the top of the socio-economic structure that controlled the majority of the rural Irish landscape. Large numbers of people that comprised the rural poor classes held almost no land and these people were the ones directly impacted by the evictions and famine that began in 1845. The Great Famine (1845-1852) resulted in millions of people who were compelled to leave because of large-scale evictions, famine, and disease.

To gain perspective about life in rural Ireland at the time of these large-scale evictions I would suggest you explore the following well researched website which provides many illustrations: the [http://www.maggieblanck.com/Mayopages/Eviction.html](http://www.maggieblanck.com/Mayopages/Eviction.html)
