The [American Geosciences Institute](http://www.americangeosciences.org/) highlights research by University of Maryland archaeologists in their publication [EARTH Magazine](http://www.earthmagazine.org/) which features excavations of the Irish enclave of Texas, MD.

In the 1840s, many Irish immigrated to the United States. Some settled in a little Maryland town they called Texas, just outside of Baltimore, where they quarried marble that was used to build some of the United States' most iconic structures. New archaeological excavations are beginning to reveal the history of this Irish-American society.

**Highlights**

The town of Texas had about 50 residents as of 1850. Within 10 years, the town had grown to roughly 600, almost exclusively people of Irish or of Irish-American heritage.

Stephen Brighton heard about Texas, Maryland from a Ballykilcline heritage society while excavating at sites in Ireland.

The archaeological evidence uncovered at these Baltimore area excavations suggests that the Irish-American community of Texas was different from previously researched Irish communities in New York City and Paterson, NJ. The descendants of the initial immigrants maintained their Irish identity significantly longer than was evidenced by earlier excavations elsewhere.

Stone from the quarries around Texas, MD made its way into numerous landmark buildings, including the Baltimore City Hall, the Washington Monument, the porticoes of the House and Senate wings of the U.S. Capital, and St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City.
