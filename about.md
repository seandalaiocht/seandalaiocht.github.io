This blog aims to inform Irish-Americans of their heritage with a special focus on the research contributions made by members of the University of Maryland community. It will explore the Irish diaspora with particular emphasis on immigration into the United States during the 19th century. The causes that resulted in this large-scale migration relate to both ethnicity and to issues of labor and the working class.

Interested readers will find much to learn regarding the process whereby their Irish ancestors entered the United States largely as despised foreigners, transitioned to Irish-Americans who chose to preserve many key elements of their culture but eventually integrated themselves deeply into American culture and society.
